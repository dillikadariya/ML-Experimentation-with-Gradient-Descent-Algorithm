# Project 1: Linear Regression with Dynamic Learning Rate

This project demonstrates batch gradient descent with a dynamic learning rate to fit a simple linear regression model.

## Objectives
- Understand batch gradient descent optimization.
- Implement a dynamic learning rate for smoother convergence.
- Visualize model performance and training loss.

## Dataset
Synthetic data generated using a linear relationship with noise.

## Methodology
- Generate observations with a linear relationship.
- Use batch gradient descent to optimize weights.
- Dynamically adjust the learning rate for efficient training.

## Results
The model successfully fits a linear trend with minimized MSE.
